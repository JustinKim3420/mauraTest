Hello this is just a quick demonstration of my skills!

For Q3, I have separated the back-end and front-end. 

Firstly, don't forget to install the related libraries for both!
Libraries used
Frontend: React, axios
Backend: express, nodemon (only for development)

To start up the front end, you can use the 'npm start' command. 
To start up the back end, you can run 'node index.js', or 'npm run test' if you want to use nodemon.
